# **What is Kubernetes?**

- Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform**

- To put it simply: Your app runs inside containers, and Kubernetes **manages those containers.**

- It **deploys, runs, scales, and manages containers** across multiple (physical/virtual) machines automatically.

- Some of the capabilities that Kubernetes offers are **balancing loads between nodes, running updates, mounting storage systems, accessing application logs, distributing secrets, debugging applications, monitoring resources**, and much, much more

**Origin**
---
- K8s started as a Google project based on how they ran **applications at scale.** 

- It later became **open source** and is now one of the most popular tools for managing containers.

- To understand Kubernetes, you must first understand containers, because Kubernetes exists to manage them.
